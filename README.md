# cmt

**cmt** is a command-line utility that generates [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) messages using OpenAI's GPT models based on staged Git changes.

It automates the process of writing clear and structured commit messages, enhancing your Git workflow and ensuring consistency across projects.

## Features

- **Automated Commit Messages**: Generates commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification using GPT.
- **Interactive TUI**: Modern terminal user interface with split-panel view showing file tree and commit message for review and editing.
- **Vim-Style Editor**: Built-in modal editor with normal and insert modes for commit message editing.
- **Deterministic State Controllers**: Each Bubble Tea state is handled by a focused controller, making behaviour predictable and extensible.
- **Custom Prefixes**: Supports adding custom prefixes to commit messages for better traceability (e.g., task IDs, issue numbers).
- **Changelog Generation**: Automatically creates changelogs based on your commit history and outputs to console.
- **Live Log Viewing**: Toggle application logs during TUI operation for debugging (press 'l' when logging format is 'ui').
- **Integration with OpenAI GPT**: Utilizes GPT models to analyze your staged changes and produce meaningful commit messages.

## Prerequisites

Before installing and using **cmt**, ensure you have the following:

- **Go**: Version 1.16 or higher is recommended.
- **Git**: Ensure Git is installed and initialized in your project.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to use GPT models.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tab/cmt.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```sh
   cd cmt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**


   ```sh
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

_For permanent setup, add the above line to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.)._

4. **Build the Binary**

   ```sh
   go build -o cmd/cmt cmd/main.go
    ```

5. **Make the Binary Executable**

   ```sh
   chmod +x cmd/cmt
   ```

6. **Move the Binary to Your PATH**

   ```sh
   sudo ln -s $(pwd)/cmd/cmt /usr/local/bin/cmt
   ```

7. **Verify Installation**

   ```sh
    cmt --version
    ```

## Configuration

**cmt** can be configured using a YAML configuration file named `cmt.yaml` placed in the current directory. Below is an example configuration file with the default settings:

```yaml
api:
  retry_count: 3  # Number of retry attempts for API requests
  timeout: 60s    # Timeout duration for API requests

model:
  name: gpt-4.1-nano # OpenAI model to use
  max_tokens: 500    # Maximum tokens for the model response
  temperature: 0.7   # Controls randomness of the model output

logging:
  format: ui         # Logging format (console, json, or ui for log buffer viewing)
  level: info        # Logging level (debug, info, warn, error)
```

You can customize any of these settings to fit your preferences.
If no configuration file is found, **cmt** will use these default values.

## Usage

Navigate to your git repository and stage the changes you want to commit:

```sh
git add .
```

Run the `cmt` command to generate a commit message:

```sh
cmt
```

Review the generated commit message in an interactive split-panel TUI:

- **Left Panel**: File tree showing staged files
- **Right Panel**: Generated commit message

**Key Bindings:**
- `a` - Accept and commit
- `e` - Edit message (opens vim-style modal editor)
- `r` - Refresh (regenerate from GPT)
- `l` - Toggle logs view (when format: ui)
- `q` - Quit without committing

If you accept (`a`), the changes will be committed:

```sh
üöÄ Changes committed:
[feature/jwt 29ca12d] feat(core): Add user authentication
 2 files changed, 106 insertions(+), 68 deletions(-)
```

### Custom Prefix

Add a custom prefix to your commit message (e.g., issue tracker ID):

```sh
cmt --prefix "JIRA-123"
# or
cmt prefix "JIRA-123"
# or
cmt -p "JIRA-123"
```

The prefix will be prepended to the generated commit message:

```
JIRA-123 feat(core): Add user authentication
```

### Changelog Generation

Generate a changelog from your commit history and output directly to console:

```sh
cmt changelog                 # From first commit to HEAD
cmt changelog v1.0.0..v1.1.0  # Between version tags
cmt changelog SHA1..SHA2      # Between specific commits
cmt changelog SHA..HEAD       # From commit to HEAD
```

The changelog is generated using GPT and output in Markdown format:

Example output:

```markdown
# CHANGELOG

## [1.1.0]

### Features

- **feat(jwt):** Add user authentication
- **feat(api):** Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(auth):** Resolve token expiration issue
```

## Architecture In Brief

- **Dependency Injection**: [`uber-go/fx`](https://github.com/uber-go/fx) wires logging, git access, GPT client, the workflow service, and the Bubble Tea UI. Application construction lives under `internal/app`.
- **Workflow Service**: `internal/app/cli/workflow` orchestrates ‚Äúfetch diff ‚Üí ask GPT ‚Üí build view data‚Äù for both commit and changelog flows. The UI never talks to Git or GPT directly.
- **State Controllers**: Each Bubble Tea state (fetch, review, edit, changelog, logs) is handled by a dedicated controller in `internal/app/cli/model/state_controller_*.go`. `Model.Update` simply delegates to the controller for the current state, eliminating the previous mega-switch.
- **Rendering Components**: Reusable view helpers and styling live in `internal/app/cli/components`, keeping Bubble Tea views declarative.
- **Tests & Tooling**: `make lint` runs `golangci-lint`; `make test` executes the whole suite with coverage reporting enabled.

## FAQ

**Q:** How do I obtain an OpenAI API key?

**A:** You can obtain an API key by signing up at [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). After signing in, navigate to the API keys section to generate a new key.

---

**Q:** How can I ensure that private information isn't shared with OpenAI?

**A:** Here are some best practices to prevent sharing private information with OpenAI:

1. **Review Staged Changes**: Before running the `cmt` command, carefully review the changes you have staged using `git diff --staged`. Ensure that no sensitive information (like passwords, API keys, or personal data) is included.
2. **Exclude Sensitive Files**: Use `.gitignore` to exclude files that contain sensitive information from being tracked and staged. For example:

   ```gitignore
   .env
   secrets/
   ```
